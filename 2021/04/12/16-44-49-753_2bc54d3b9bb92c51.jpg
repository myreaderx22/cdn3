We&#8217;ll spend part of this week digging into the global venture capital scene&#8217;s Q1 performance, but today, we&#8217;re kicking off with a quick dive into Uber, Lyft, Deliveroo and DoorDash &#8212; and the ability of on-demand companies of various stripes to generate profit.<\/p>\n<p>Uber is our lodestone today because it dropped a <a href=\"https:\/\/d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net\/CIK-0001543151\/84bcb1ae-108c-493b-a622-c8fcd2bb29b7.pdf\">new SEC filing<\/a> that includes some notes on its recent performance.

We mean Uber is providing its public investors with notes on its future <em>adjusted<\/em> profitability. Real profits are still somewhere out in the uncharted future.<\/p>\n<p>So let&#8217;s parse Uber&#8217;s latest, vet its profit promise, consider its rivals and their performance, and then ask ourselves if the great ride-hailing and food-delivery booms will ever make back the money they cost to scale.<\/p>\n<h2>Uber&#8217;s planned profits<\/h2>\n<p>In 2019, Lyft told investors to expect positive adjusted EBITDA by the final quarter of 2021; at the time, Uber said it would generate full-year positive adjusted EBITDA. Those are slightly different (if related) promises. Later, Uber <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/07\/unpacking-ubers-new-profitability-promise\/\">moved up its profitability promise to Q4 2020<\/a>, but that was not to be.<\/p>\n<p>After Uber changed up its profitability timeline, COVID-19 came. The pandemic forced the American ride-hailing company <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/08\/uber-pushes-adjusted-quarterly-profit-target-to-2021\/\">to revert<\/a> to its previous adjusted profitability promises.<\/p>\n<p>Uber and Lyft took huge revenue hits as their core ride-hailing businesses dried up faster than water on a Texas sidewalk after COVID-19 lockdowns took effect. In response, Uber <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/05\/huge-delivery-demand-fails-to-stop-ubers-revenue-from-shrinking-in-q3\/\">fell back on its Uber Eats business<\/a>, while Lyft had to get by without a second business line.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last month was Uber&#8217;s best in history in terms of gross sales on its platform.

deal<\/a>, the company said this was about increasing its presence in the healthcare vertical, a place where Nuance has done well in recent years. In fact, the company announced the Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare last year, and this deal is about accelerating its presence there. Nuance&#8217;s products in this area include Dragon Ambient eXperience, Dragon Medical One and PowerScribe One for radiology reporting.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Today\u2019s acquisition announcement represents the latest step in Microsoft\u2019s industry-specific cloud strategy,&#8221; the company wrote. The acquisition also builds on several integrations and partnerships the two companies have made in the last couple of years.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The company boasts 10,000 healthcare customers, according to information on the website. Those include AthenaHealth, Johns Hopkins, Mass General Brigham and Cleveland Clinic to name but a few, and it was that customer base that attracted Microsoft to pay the price it did to bring Nuance into the fold.<\/p>\n<p>Nuance CEO Mark Benjamin will remain with the company and report to Scott Guthrie, Microsoft&#8217;s EVP in charge of the cloud and AI group.<\/p>\n<p>Nuance has a complex history. It went public in 2000 and began buying speech recognition products including Dragon Dictate from Lernout Hauspie in 2001. It merged with a company called ScanSoft in 2005. That company began life as Visioneer, a scanning company in 1992.<\/p>\n<p>Today, the company has a number of products including Dragon Dictate, a consumer and business text to speech product that dates back to the early 1990s. It&#8217;s also involved in speech recognition, chat bots and natural language processing particularly in healthcare and other verticals.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"0ScQlhF99D\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/06\/04\/microsoft-has-acquired-github-for-7-5b-in-microsoft-stock\/\">Microsoft has acquired GitHub for $7.5B in stock<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Microsoft has acquired GitHub for $7.5B in stock&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/06\/04\/microsoft-has-acquired-github-for-7-5b-in-microsoft-stock\/embed\/#?secret=0ScQlhF99D\" data-secret=\"0ScQlhF99D\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The company has 6,000 employees spread across 27 countries.

That&#8217;s not the direction a company wants to go in, but it is still a run rate of over $1.4 billion.<\/p>\n<p>At the time of that earnings call, the company also announced it was selling its medical transcription and electronic health record (EHR) Go-Live services to Assured Healthcare Partners and Aeries Technology Group.

affects store operations.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>On certain days and times, customers ordering from the Woodland Heights store on the Domino&#8217;s website can request R2, which uses radar, 360-degree cameras and thermal imaging to direct its movement. <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">They&#8217;ll get texts to let them know where the robot is and what PIN they&#8217;ll need to access their pizza via the bot&#8217;s touchscreen. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Over the course of the pandemic, the contactless, autonomous food delivery industry has accelerated quickly, and Nuro is currently poised to become a leader in this space.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u201cNuro\u2019s mission is to better everyday life through robotics,&#8221; Dave Ferguson, Nuro co-founder and president, said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to introduce our autonomous delivery bots to a select set of Domino\u2019s customers in Houston. We can\u2019t wait to see what they think.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This is the first time meals will be delivered by an electric, self-driving, occupant-less vehicle on the roads in Houston. Woodland Heights, which is mainly residential, is one of the oldest historic neighborhoods in Houston, flanked by the I-45 and I-10 highways. The Domino&#8217;s there is right on Houston Avenue, a main thoroughfare, making this a substantially challenging space in which to pilot this technology.<\/p>\n<p>Nuro originally <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/technology\/2019\/06\/17\/dominos-will-start-delivering-pizzas-via-an-autonomous-robot-this-fall\/\">announced the Domino&#8217;s partnership and began testing in Houston in 2019<\/a>. That same year, the company began deploying its vehicles to transport Kroger groceries in Houston and Phoenix. At the end of 2020, it was <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/23\/nuro-can-now-operate-and-charge-for-autonomous-delivery-services-in-california\/\">approved to begin testing on public roads in California<\/a>, delivering goods from partners like Walmart and CVS. Nuro is the first company to be granted regulatory approval by the U.S. Department of Transportation for a self-driving vehicle exemption.<\/p>\n<p>Domino&#8217;s appears to be Nuro&#8217;s first large foray into restaurant delivery, but it certainly won&#8217;t be the last. The company just announced its $500 million Series C round, funded in part by Chipotle. Woven Capital, the investment arm of Toyota&#8217;s innovation-focused subsidiary Woven Planet, also invested, kicking off the fund&#8217;s portfolio.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"xxlEXnXfhV\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/26\/woven-capital-kicks-off-portfolio-with-investment-in-autonomous-delivery-company-nuro\/\">Woven Capital kicks off portfolio with investment in autonomous delivery company Nuro<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Woven Capital kicks off portfolio with investment in autonomous delivery company Nuro&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/26\/woven-capital-kicks-off-portfolio-with-investment-in-autonomous-delivery-company-nuro\/embed\/#?secret=xxlEXnXfhV\" data-secret=\"xxlEXnXfhV\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Starting this week, some Domino&#8217;s customers in Houston can have a pizza delivered without ever interacting with a human.

Using a simple share count of 516,545,035, the company would be worth $22.2 billion to $25.8 billion at the lower and upper extremes of its expected price interval. Neither of those numbers is close to what it was worth, in theory, just a few months ago.<\/p>\n<p>According to IPO watching group Renaissance Capital, UiPath <a href=\"https:\/\/www.renaissancecapital.com\/IPO-Center\/News\/80660\/Software-maker-UiPath-sets-terms-for-$990-million-IPO\">is worth<\/a> up to $26.0 billion on a fully diluted basis. That&#8217;s not much more than its simple valuation.<\/p>\n<p>For UiPath, its initial IPO price interval is a disappointment, though the company could see an upward revision in its valuation before it does sell shares and begin to trade. But more to the point, the company&#8217;s private-market valuation bump followed by a quick public-market correction stands out as a counter-example to something that we&#8217;ve seen so frequently in recent months.<\/p>\n<p>Is UiPath&#8217;s first IPO price interval <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/01\/compass-ceo-hails-ipo-as-a-fundraising-event-amid-challenging-market\/\">another indicator<\/a> that the IPO market is cooling?<\/p>\n<h2>Remember Roblox?<\/h2>\n<p>If you think back to the end of 2020, Roblox decided to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/14\/ipo-delays-are-bumming-me-out\/\">cancel its IPO<\/a> and pursue a direct listing instead.

wildfires rage close, Perimeter wants to tell you where to go"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Out the window, a fire is raging \u2014 and it\u2019s moving ever closer. Confusion. Fear. A run for the car. Roads open and then suddenly closed by authorities. Traffic jams. A fire break that stalls the flames and then suddenly the flames jump, changing direction. Everyone has a plan for what to do \u2014 a plan that gets ripped up the second someone leaves their home to evacuate.<\/p>\n<p>In the heat of the moment, everyone needs to know exactly what to do and where to go. Unfortunately, that information is rarely available in the format they need.<\/p>\n<p>Bailey Farren\u2019s family has experienced this four times living in California north of San Francisco. The wildfires are more common than ever with the aridness of climate change, yet the evacuations remain a pandemonium. While a student at Berkeley, she started investigating what was happening, and why her family constantly lacked the information they needed to get out safely and swiftly. \u201cI thought that first responders had everything they need,\u201d she said.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>They don\u2019t. Firefighters on the frontlines often lack the technology needed to relay accurate information to operations centers, which can then guide citizens on how to evacuate. With the pressing need to keep citizens up-to-date, most authorities rely on simple text messages to just tell everyone in, say, an entire county to evacuate, with nary more detail.<\/p>\n<p>The Camp Fire in California in 2018, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/nation\/2018\/11\/25\/camp-fire-deadliest-wildfire-californias-history-has-been-contained\/\">the worst fire in California\u2019s history<\/a>, triggered her to go beyond interviewing public safety officers to building a solution. She graduated in spring 2019, and at the same time, founded Perimeter with fellow Berkeley grad Noah Wu.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/perimeterplatform.com\">Perimeter<\/a> is an emergency response platform designed to \u201cbridge the gap between agencies and citizens\u201d in Farren\u2019s words by offering better two-way communication centered on geospatial data.<\/p>\n<p>The company announced today that it has raised a $1 million pre-seed round led by Parade Ventures with Dustin Dolginow, social-impact organization One World, and Alchemist Accelerator participating. Alchemist was the first money into the startup.<\/p>\n<p>Using Perimeter, citizens can upload geospatial-tagged information such as a new fire outbreak or a tree that has fallen and is now blocking a road. \u201cSometimes citizens have the most accurate and real-time information, before first responders show up \u2014 we want citizens to share that with \u2026 government officials,\u201d Farren said. That information is not immediately disseminated to the public though. Instead, first responders can vet the information, ensuring that citizens are always using accurate information in planning their actions. \u201cWe do not want it to be a social-media platform,\u201d she explained.<\/p>\n<p>In the other direction, operations centers can use Perimeter to send citizens accurate and detailed evacuation maps with routes on where to go. Unlike with just a text message, Perimeter will send both the message and a URL, which can then display maps and real-time information on how a disaster is progressing.<\/p>\n<p>Right now, the platform is distributed as a web app, so that citizens don\u2019t need to have it pre-installed when a disaster strikes. Farren noted that the company is working on native apps as well, particularly for first responders who need robust offline capabilities due to intermittent cell signals that are typical in disaster zones.<\/p>\n<p>Farren and her team have interviewed emergency management agencies extensively, and she says that her first customer is Palo Alto\u2019s Office of Emergency Services. Over the past two fire seasons, \u201cwe had an R&amp;D focus in that we were building hand-in-hand with agencies \u2026 and we took two fire seasons to beta test our technology,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>The company has four full-time employees working remotely, but all based in California.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"KquPw4k1yv\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/02\/cornea-eyes-in-on-fighting-wildfires-using-better-data\/\">Cornea eyes in on fighting wildfires using better data<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Cornea eyes in on fighting wildfires using better data&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/02\/cornea-eyes-in-on-fighting-wildfires-using-better-data\/embed\/#?secret=KquPw4k1yv\" data-secret=\"KquPw4k1yv\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Out the window, a fire is raging \u2014 and it\u2019s moving ever closer.

Today, more than 54 million vehicles have Mobileye technology.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This is a great combination of the two partners together and we expect some great scale,&#8221; Jack Weast, a senior principal engineer at Intel and the Vice President of Automated Vehicle Standards at Mobileye, said in a recent interview. &#8220;And this does kind of mark, officially, the first proof point of Mobileye&#8217;s technology getting into goods delivery in addition to all the other spaces that we&#8217;ve already announced.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The company, which was acquired by Intel for $15.3 billion in 2017, has widened its scope in recent years, moving beyond its advanced driver assistance technology and toward the development of a self-driving vehicle system. More than two years ago, Mobileye announced plans to launch a kit that includes visual perception, sensor fusion, its <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/01\/08\/intels-mobileye-will-have-2-million-cars-on-roads-building-hd-maps-in-2018\/\">REM mapping system<\/a> and software algorithms. And in 2018, the company made an unlikely turn and announced plans to become a robotaxi operator, not just a supplier. Mobileye also plans to deploy autonomous shuttles with Transdev ATS and Lohr Group beginning in Europe. Mobileye also plans to begin operating an autonomous ride-hailing service in Israel in early 2022.<\/p>\n<p>This latest deal shows Mobileye&#8217;s ambition to see its self-driving systems used in other applications beyond robotaxis.<\/p>\n<p>The self-driving system, now branded as Mobilieye Drive, is made up of a system-on-chip based compute,\u00a0redundant sensing subsystems based on camera, radar and lidar technology, its REM mapping system and a rules-based Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) driving policy. Mobileye\u2019s REM mapping system essentially crowdsources data by tapping into more than 1 million vehicles equipped with its tech to build high-definition maps that can be used to support in ADAS and autonomous driving systems.<\/p>\n<p>Udelv will work with Mobileye to integrate the self-driving technology with its own delivery management system.

Those are slightly different (if related) promises. Later, Uber <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/07\/unpacking-ubers-new-profitability-promise\/\">moved up its profitability promise to Q4 2020<\/a>, but that was not to be.<\/p>\n<p>After Uber changed up its profitability timeline, COVID-19 came.

excused for doing a Monday morning double take at the hefty price tag.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s surely a lot of money for a company on a $1.4 billion run rate, but Microsoft, which has already partnered with the speech-to-text market leader on several products over the last couple of years, saw a company firmly embedded in healthcare and it decided to go all in.<\/p>\n<p>And $20 billion is certainly all in, even for a company the size of Microsoft. But 2020 forced us to change the way we do business from restaurants to retailers to doctors. In fact, the pandemic in particular changed the way we interact with our medical providers. We learned very quickly that you don&#8217;t have to drive to an office, wait in waiting room, then in an exam room, all to see the doctor for a few minutes.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Instead, we can get on the line, have a quick chat and be on our way. It won&#8217;t work for every condition of course &#8212; there will always be times the physician needs to see you &#8212; but for many meetings such as reviewing test results or for talk therapy, telehealth could suffice.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"TiDK0lsO4D\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/12\/where-top-vcs-are-investing-in-healthcare-b2b-and-infrastructure\/\">Where top VCs are investing in healthcare B2B and infrastructure<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Where top VCs are investing in healthcare B2B and infrastructure&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/12\/where-top-vcs-are-investing-in-healthcare-b2b-and-infrastructure\/embed\/#?secret=TiDK0lsO4D\" data-secret=\"TiDK0lsO4D\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that Nuance is at the center of this shift, especially with its use of cloud and artificial intelligence, and that&#8217;s why the company was willing to pay the amount it did to get it.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;AI is technology\u2019s most important priority, and healthcare is its most urgent application. Together, with our partner ecosystem, we will put advanced AI solutions into the hands of professionals everywhere to drive better decision-making and create more meaningful connections, as we accelerate growth of Microsoft Cloud in Healthcare and Nuance,&#8221; Nadella said <a href=\"https:\/\/news.microsoft.com\/2021\/04\/12\/microsoft-accelerates-industry-cloud-strategy-for-healthcare-with-the-acquisition-of-nuance\/\">in a post announcing the deal<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research, says says that may be so, but he believes that Microsoft missed the boat with Cortana and this is about helping the company catch up on a crucial technology. &#8220;Nuance will be not only give Microsoft technology help in regards to neural network based speech recognition, but also a massive improvement from vertical capabilities, call center functionality and the MSFT IP position in speech,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Microsoft sees this deal doubling what was already a considerable total addressable market to nearly $500 billion. While TAMs always tend to run high, that is still a substantial number.<\/p>\n<p>It also fits with Gartner data, which found that by 2022, 75% of healthcare organizations will have a formal cloud strategy in place. The AI component only adds to that number and Nuance brings 10,000 existing customers to Microsoft including some of the biggest healthcare organizations in the world.<\/p>\n<p>Brent Leary, founder and principal analyst at CRM Essentials, says the deal could provide Microsoft with a ton of health data to help feed the underlying machine learning models and make them more accurate over time.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There is going be a ton of health data being captured by the interactions coming through telemedicine interactions, and this could create a whole new level of health intelligence,&#8221; Leary told me.<\/p>\n<p>That of course could drive a lot of privacy concerns where health data is involved, and it will be up to Microsoft, which just experienced <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/12\/hackers-exchange-servers-ransomware\/\">a major breach on its Exchange<\/a> email server products last month, to assure the public that their sensitive health data is being protected.<\/p>\n<p>Leary says that ensuring data privacy is going to be absolutely key to the success of the deal. &#8220;The potential this move has is pretty powerful, but it will only be realized if the data and insights that could come from it are protected and secure &#8212; not only protected from hackers but also from unethical use. Either could derail what could be a game changing move,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Microsoft also seemed to recognize that when it wrote, &#8220;Nuance and Microsoft will deepen their existing commitments to the extended partner ecosystem, as well as the highest standards of data privacy, security and compliance.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>We are clearly on the edge of a sea change when it comes to how we interact with our medical providers in the future. COVID pushed medicine deeper into the digital realm in 2020 out of simple necessity. It wasn&#8217;t safe to go into the office unless absolutely necessary.<\/p>\n<p>The Nuance acquisition, which is expected to close some time later this year, could help Microsoft shift deeper into the market.

says with a laugh. The story that landed <a href=\"https:\/\/astrohaus.com\/\">Astrohaus<\/a> in Detroit on two separate occasions is a bit tangled, certainly. The hardware startup\u2019s cofounder and CEO isn\u2019t the sort of hometown cheerleader you often encounter when speaking with executives who\u2019ve opted to keep their organizations outside cities like San Francisco or New York.<\/p>\n<p>Hailing from Detroit\u2019s outer suburbs, Leeb cofounded the company in the Motor City in Fall 2014 with Patrick Paul. Astrohaus\u2019s first \u2013 and best known \u2013 product was born as an attempt to offer users a \u201cdistraction-free writing experience.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not even a writer,\u201d Leeb says of the product\u2019s inception. \u201cWhat interests me about the product \u2013 what got me going \u2013 is yes, it\u2019s about writing, but common among all of the things I\u2019m interested in, is it\u2019s more about process and productivity. That\u2019s something I\u2019m super passionate about. And making things easier that get out of your way and are really fun to use.\u201d<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Leeb, an MIT mechanical engineering graduate and Paul a Michigan State graduate and software developer met through the Detroit startup community and got to work prototyping a word processing device that delivered the benefits of modern tech, without the sort of inherent distractions of computers and tablets that today\u2019s writers know all too well.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"z85CqJAEkd\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/12\/dive-into-detroits-growing-startup-scene-with-techcrunchs-detroit-city-spotlight\/\">Dive into Detroit&#8217;s growing startup scene with TechCrunch&#8217;s Detroit City Spotlight and meetup<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Dive into Detroit&#8217;s growing startup scene with TechCrunch&#8217;s Detroit City Spotlight and meetup&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/12\/dive-into-detroits-growing-startup-scene-with-techcrunchs-detroit-city-spotlight\/embed\/#?secret=z85CqJAEkd\" data-secret=\"z85CqJAEkd\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The young company introduced itself to the world by way of Kickstarter, launching a campaign in 2014.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Hemingwrite combines the best features of all previous writing tools with the addition of modern technology,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cIt is dedicated like a typewriter, has a better keyboard and battery life than your computer and is distraction free like a word processor. Finally, we sync your documents to the cloud in real-time so you never have to worry about saving, syncing or backing up your work.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The product was greeted with excitement and some gentle-ribbing (and some not-so-gentle, including one review that called it <a href=\"https:\/\/mashable.com\/2016\/02\/24\/freewrite-word-processor\/\">&#8220;pretentious hipster nonsense&#8221;<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">) over a $500 reinvention of the typewriter. The crowdfunding community went wild, with nearly $350,000 raised. In June of 2015, the product was renamed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are updating our brand with a more demonstrative name that also no longer ties us to the persona of a certain famous writer,\u201d the company wrote in a June 2015 Kickstarter updated. Two months later, Astrohaus relocated to New York City.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI was really itching to leave. I didn\u2019t know how we were going to make it in Detroit,\u201d Leeb says. \u201cThere\u2019s not really a hardware scene and my connections were mostly in New York. I pushed Patrick \u2013 we had raised some money and gotten going, so I was like, \u2018let\u2019s move to New York.\u2019 There\u2019s definitely more of a hardware scene and we were definitely a part of it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Once again, life intervened. Paul left the company and Leeb married Kacee Must, a Detroit resident \u2013 and owner of local yoga chain, Citizen Yoga. In 2018, he found himself building Astrohaus up again in the city where it started life. Three years later, the team is still a fairly lean one, with five full time employees in Detroit and a more distributed team of contractors.<\/p>\n<p>Leeb\u2019s feelings about launching a hardware startup in Detroit are clearly mixed. He bemoans the difficultly in recruiting and finding funding locally, while acknowledging a sense of local cheerleading one really finds in larger cities. \u201cWith these smaller ecosystems, you really get to know people everywhere,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone is so accessible. As far as anywhere I\u2019ve ever been, Detroit companies really cheer for each other. There\u2019s so much Detroit pride.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For all of the talk of returning manufacturing to Detroit, Leeb says he\u2019s had little luck in his pursuit to get the Freewrite and subsequent products created in the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a whole other world of advanced manufacturing startups that definitely get a lot of benefits from being in a manufacturing hub,\u201d he says. \u201cI think for software companies and for us it\u2019s not so beneficial. We make our goods in China, and I don\u2019t see that changing any time soon. I have good relationships with our factories and I spend a lot of time in China. That\u2019s what they\u2019re geared toward. They make consumer electronics.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2066028\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2066028\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2066028\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/freewrite-traveler-4.jpg\" alt=\"Astrohaus' Freewrite Traveler on a table\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/freewrite-traveler-4.jpg 2400w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/freewrite-traveler-4.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/freewrite-traveler-4.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/freewrite-traveler-4.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/freewrite-traveler-4.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/freewrite-traveler-4.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/freewrite-traveler-4.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/freewrite-traveler-4.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2066028\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Darrell Etherington<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Leeb says he\u2019s found the Andrew Yang-founded Venture for America nonprofit a useful source of hiring locally. In the years following Astrohaus\u2019 launch, impressions of the city have changed radically from a depressed byproduct of rust belt boom and bust to a viable place to launch a business.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe last 10 years, there\u2019s a massive difference in the city,\u201d Leeb says. \u201c[Quicken Loans cofounder] Dan Gilbert almost single-handedly brought the city back. There are a lot of people who hate him, but the reality is that, while he wasn\u2019t the only billionaire in town, he\u2019s the only one who heavily invested in Detroit. He consolidated all of his suburban offices and put them in downtown and he convinced all of these companies to do the same.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Covid-19 pandemic will no doubt continue to have repercussions, as remote work becomes the norm for many or most tech outlets. Though hardware startups will always have a compelling reason to keep things in close quarters, as companies develop and test products. For his part, Leeb says Astrohaus\u2019 next device aims to address concerns about remote collaboration.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m very aggressively starting to work on a new hardware product that is a collaboration and communication tool,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a problem before, and now it\u2019s such a widespread problem that I feel we\u2019re lacking in certain communication. There\u2019s a lot to be done there. I don\u2019t feel as connected as we could be, even with the technology we have.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/detroit\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2135814\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/detroit-footer-banner.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"141\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/detroit-footer-banner.jpg 3200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/detroit-footer-banner.jpg?resize=150,21 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/detroit-footer-banner.jpg?resize=300,41 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/detroit-footer-banner.jpg?resize=768,106 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/detroit-footer-banner.jpg?resize=680,94 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/detroit-footer-banner.jpg?resize=1536,211 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/detroit-footer-banner.jpg?resize=2048,282 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/detroit-footer-banner.jpg?resize=50,7 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of a messy story,\u201d Adam Leeb says with a laugh.

This means Qiskit users can now bring their programs to IonQ&#8217;s platform without any major modifications to their code.<\/p>\n<p>At first glance, that seems relatively unremarkable, but it&#8217;s worth noting that Qiskit was founded by IBM Research and is IBM&#8217;s default tool for working with its quantum computers. There is a healthy bit of competition between IBM and IonQ (and, to be fair, many others in this space), in part because both are betting on very different technologies at the core of their platforms. While IonQ is betting on trapped ions, which allows its machines able to run at room temperature, IBM&#8217;s technique requires its machine to be supercooled.<\/p>\n<p>IonQ has now released a new provider library for Qiskit that is available as part of the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Qiskit-Partners\">Qiskit Partner<\/a> repository on GitHub and via the <a href=\"https:\/\/pypi.org\/project\/qiskit-ionq\/\">Python Package Index<\/a>.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;IonQ is excited to make our quantum computers and APIs easily accessible to the Qiskit community,&#8221; said IonQ CEO &amp; President Peter Chapman. &#8220;Open source has already revolutionized traditional software development. With this integration, we\u2019re bringing the world one step closer to the first generation of widely-applicable quantum applications.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the one hand, it&#8217;s hard not to look at this as IonQ needling IBM a bit, but it&#8217;s also an acknowledgment that Qiskit has become somewhat of a standard for developers who want to work with quantum computers. But putting these rivalries aside, we&#8217;re also in the early days of quantum computing and with no clear leader yet, anything that makes these various platforms more interoperable is a win for developers who want to dip their feet into writing for them.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Ph02kSVd1K\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/09\/ionq-plans-to-launch-a-rack-mounted-quantum-computer-for-data-centers-in-2023\/\">IonQ plans to launch a rack-mounted quantum computer for data centers in 2023<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;IonQ plans to launch a rack-mounted quantum computer for data centers in 2023&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/09\/ionq-plans-to-launch-a-rack-mounted-quantum-computer-for-data-centers-in-2023\/embed\/#?secret=Ph02kSVd1K\" data-secret=\"Ph02kSVd1K\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"WKT5BmKkSY\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/29\/ibm-launches-its-first-quantum-developer-certification\/\">IBM launches its first quantum developer certification<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;IBM launches its first quantum developer certification&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/29\/ibm-launches-its-first-quantum-developer-certification\/embed\/#?secret=WKT5BmKkSY\" data-secret=\"WKT5BmKkSY\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>IonQ, the trapped ion quantum computing company that recently announced that it wants to go public via a SPAC, today announced that it is integrating its quantum computing platform with the open-source Qiskit software development kit.

In fact, the company announced the Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare last year, and this deal is about accelerating its presence there. Nuance&#8217;s products in this area include Dragon Ambient eXperience, Dragon Medical One and PowerScribe One for radiology reporting.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Today\u2019s acquisition announcement represents the latest step in Microsoft\u2019s industry-specific cloud strategy,&#8221; the company wrote. The acquisition also builds on several integrations and partnerships the two companies have made in the last couple of years.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The company boasts 10,000 healthcare customers, according to information on the website. Those include AthenaHealth, Johns Hopkins, Mass General Brigham and Cleveland Clinic to name but a few, and it was that customer base that attracted Microsoft to pay the price it did to bring Nuance into the fold.<\/p>\n<p>Nuance CEO Mark Benjamin will remain with the company and report to Scott Guthrie, Microsoft&#8217;s EVP in charge of the cloud and AI group.<\/p>\n<p>Nuance has a complex history. It went public in 2000 and began buying speech recognition products including Dragon Dictate from Lernout Hauspie in 2001. It merged with a company called ScanSoft in 2005. That company began life as Visioneer, a scanning company in 1992.<\/p>\n<p>Today, the company has a number of products including Dragon Dictate, a consumer and business text to speech product that dates back to the early 1990s. It&#8217;s also involved in speech recognition, chat bots and natural language processing particularly in healthcare and other verticals.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"0ScQlhF99D\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/06\/04\/microsoft-has-acquired-github-for-7-5b-in-microsoft-stock\/\">Microsoft has acquired GitHub for $7.5B in stock<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Microsoft has acquired GitHub for $7.5B in stock&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/06\/04\/microsoft-has-acquired-github-for-7-5b-in-microsoft-stock\/embed\/#?secret=0ScQlhF99D\" data-secret=\"0ScQlhF99D\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The company has 6,000 employees spread across 27 countries.

to Bloomberg<\/a>. It&#8217;s also said to be working on a smart speaker that basically combines a HomePod with an iPad, providing something similar to Amazon&#8217;s Echo Show or Google&#8217;s Nest Hub in functionality.<\/p>\n<p>The Apple TV\/HomePod hybrid would still connect to a television for outputting video, and would offer similar access to all the video and gaming services that the current Apple TV does, while the speaker component would provide sound output, music playback, and Siri integration. It would also include a built-in camera for using video conferencing apps on the TV itself, the report says.<\/p>\n<p>That second device would be much more like existing smart assistant display devices on the market today, with an iPad-like screen providing integrated visuals. The project could involve attaching the iPad via a &#8220;robotic arm&#8221; according to Bloomberg, that would allow it to move to accommodate a user moving around, with the ability to keep them in frame during video chat sessions.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"eDAqpMNJXr\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/03\/27\/digging-into-apples-media-transformation\/\">Digging into Apple&#8217;s media transformation<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Digging into Apple&#8217;s media transformation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/03\/27\/digging-into-apples-media-transformation\/embed\/#?secret=eDAqpMNJXr\" data-secret=\"eDAqpMNJXr\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Bloomberg doesn&#8217;t provide any specific timelines for release of any of these potential products, and it sounds like they&#8217;re still very much in the development phase, which means Apple could easily abandon these plans depending on its evaluation of their potential.

offset a shopper&#8217;s carbon emissions.<\/p>\n<p>About 10,000 companies work with EcoCart, either through direct partnerships, or passive affiliate marketing services. EcoCart also offers a carbon accounting tool for businesses and an offsetting offering for them as well, according to co-founders Peter Twomey and Dane Baker.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The San Francisco-based startup uses services like <a href=\"https:\/\/climeco.com\/\">ClimeCo<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bluesource.com\/\">BlueSource<\/a> to source and aggregate offset projects that companies can finance.<\/p>\n<p>The two co-founders, who met at the University of San Diego previously founded a startup called Toyroom, which rented outdoor equipment to customers in an effort to reduce unnecessary consumption.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;We live this problem ourselves. We realized it was incredibly difficult to maintain this sustainability ethos,&#8221; Baker said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>While the browser extension sets EcoCart apart from other offsetting services like Cloverly, the company does share some functionality in its business-facing offering where<a href=\"https:\/\/ecocart.io\/business\/\"> an option to offset the carbon associated with a purchase<\/a> is integrated directly into the checkout flow.<\/p>\n<p>EcoCart launched its business-to-business integration in June of last year and now counts 500 vendors as customers. So far, about a quarter of customers have chosen to offset their purchases at checkout amounting to the capture of an estimated 25 million pounds of CO2, the company said.<\/p>\n<p>Investors backing the company include Base 10 Partners; PopSugar co-founder, Brian Sugar&#8217;s early stage venture fund and angel investors like Ben Jabbaway, the founder of Privy; Rich Gardner, the VP of global partnerships at Klaviyo; Kyle Hency, the co-founder of Chubbie; Bryan Meehan, the chair of Blue Bottle Coffee; and Carly Strife, the co-founder of BarkBox.<\/p>\n<p>While online shopping gets a bad reputation, it&#8217;s actually sometimes a greener option than shopping in physical stores, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/d41586-020-00562-y\">according to one study published in Nature last year<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Consumer offsets, while well-meaning, don&#8217;t have nearly the same impact as having the companies themselves actually rein in their greenhouse gas emissions and decarbonize their operations. In fact, the whole notion of the consumer carbon footprint and the personal responsibility of consumers for planetary pollution was <a href=\"https:\/\/mashable.com\/feature\/carbon-footprint-pr-campaign-sham\/\">dreamed up by advertising executives at the behest of oil and gas and consumer goods companies pushing products<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>But something is better than nothing, and offsets do help necessary projects get funding.<\/p>\n<p>EcoCart said it spent months developing a proprietary algorithm to calculate the carbon footprint of online orders. For both the e-commerce plugin and browser extension, EcoCart uses the characteristics of each order including material inputs to the item, shipping distance, and package weight to estimate the emissions created from that order, the company said.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe believe EcoCart is reinventing how brands interact with their customers while also managing and addressing their environmental impact at scale,\u201d said Chris Zeoli, Principal at Base10 Partners, in a statement. \u201cEcoCart represents a solution that is helping reverse decades of harmful climate change.

without ever interacting with a human.<\/p>\n<p>The pizza delivery giant said Monday it has partnered with autonomous delivery vehicle startup Nuro to allow select customers to have their pizzas dropped at their door via Nuro&#8217;s R2 robot.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere is still so much for our brand to learn about the autonomous delivery space,&#8221; Dennis Maloney, Domino\u2019s senior vice president and chief innovation officer said in a statement. &#8220;This program will allow us to better understand how customers respond to the deliveries, how they interact with the robot and how it affects store operations.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>On certain days and times, customers ordering from the Woodland Heights store on the Domino&#8217;s website can request R2, which uses radar, 360-degree cameras and thermal imaging to direct its movement. <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">They&#8217;ll get texts to let them know where the robot is and what PIN they&#8217;ll need to access their pizza via the bot&#8217;s touchscreen. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Over the course of the pandemic, the contactless, autonomous food delivery industry has accelerated quickly, and Nuro is currently poised to become a leader in this space.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u201cNuro\u2019s mission is to better everyday life through robotics,&#8221; Dave Ferguson, Nuro co-founder and president, said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to introduce our autonomous delivery bots to a select set of Domino\u2019s customers in Houston. We can\u2019t wait to see what they think.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This is the first time meals will be delivered by an electric, self-driving, occupant-less vehicle on the roads in Houston. Woodland Heights, which is mainly residential, is one of the oldest historic neighborhoods in Houston, flanked by the I-45 and I-10 highways. The Domino&#8217;s there is right on Houston Avenue, a main thoroughfare, making this a substantially challenging space in which to pilot this technology.<\/p>\n<p>Nuro originally <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/technology\/2019\/06\/17\/dominos-will-start-delivering-pizzas-via-an-autonomous-robot-this-fall\/\">announced the Domino&#8217;s partnership and began testing in Houston in 2019<\/a>. That same year, the company began deploying its vehicles to transport Kroger groceries in Houston and Phoenix. At the end of 2020, it was <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/23\/nuro-can-now-operate-and-charge-for-autonomous-delivery-services-in-california\/\">approved to begin testing on public roads in California<\/a>, delivering goods from partners like Walmart and CVS. Nuro is the first company to be granted regulatory approval by the U.S. Department of Transportation for a self-driving vehicle exemption.<\/p>\n<p>Domino&#8217;s appears to be Nuro&#8217;s first large foray into restaurant delivery, but it certainly won&#8217;t be the last. The company just announced its $500 million Series C round, funded in part by Chipotle. Woven Capital, the investment arm of Toyota&#8217;s innovation-focused subsidiary Woven Planet, also invested, kicking off the fund&#8217;s portfolio.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"xxlEXnXfhV\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/26\/woven-capital-kicks-off-portfolio-with-investment-in-autonomous-delivery-company-nuro\/\">Woven Capital kicks off portfolio with investment in autonomous delivery company Nuro<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Woven Capital kicks off portfolio with investment in autonomous delivery company Nuro&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/26\/woven-capital-kicks-off-portfolio-with-investment-in-autonomous-delivery-company-nuro\/embed\/#?secret=xxlEXnXfhV\" data-secret=\"xxlEXnXfhV\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Starting this week, some Domino&#8217;s customers in Houston can have a pizza delivered without ever interacting with a human.
